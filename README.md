GConsoleNGUI
============

NGUI Frontend for GConsole
See [GConsole](https://github.com/Rahazan/GConsole).

See [releases](https://github.com/Rahazan/GConsoleNGUI/releases) for UnityPackage releases.


#Setup:

* Make sure NGUI is present in your project.
* Place the GConsoleNGUI folder anywhere in your assets folder.
* Put a GConsolePanel prefab in your NGUI hierarchy (somewhere under the camera). There is a script attached that enables/disables (shows and hides) the UI on button down (P by default).
