GConsoleNGUI
============

NGUI Frontend for GConsole


See [GConsole](https://github.com/Rahazan/GConsole).


#Setup:

* Place the GConsoleNGUI folder anywhere in your assets folder.
* Put a GConsolePanel prefab in your NGUI hierarchy (somewhere under the camera). There is a script attached that enables/disables (shows and hides) the UI on button down (P by default).
